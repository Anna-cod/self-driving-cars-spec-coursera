# Self-Driving Cars Specialization Coursera

This Specialization gives you a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. You'll get to interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)‚Äïall through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.

Throughout your courses, you‚Äôll hear from industry experts who work at companies like Oxbotica and Zoox as they share insights about autonomous technology and how that is powering job growth within the field.

You‚Äôll learn from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modelling and environmental conditions. When you complete the Specialization successfully, you‚Äôll be able to build your own self-driving software stack and be ready to apply for jobs in the autonomous vehicle industry.

## THIS IS MY ON-GOING REPOSITORY FOR THIS COURSE (LET'S LEARN WITH [ME](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khainx/))
It works best with the integrated Coursera Lab (a Coursera's web-based Jupyter with private graders). To run it outside, please comment unused codes.

*I have consulted many sources, especially on the discussion forum. You can use my code as a reference. Please ‚≠ê if you find it useful.*
